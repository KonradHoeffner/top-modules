# Versioning
Whenever you are creating or changing an entity, a new version is created. You can see the current version of an entity on the top of the entities tab (see screenshot below).

![Version of an entity](../../assets/images/phenotype-editor-version.png)

By clicking on the clock on the top right side, all versions of the entity are displayed. You can jump to previous versions by left clicking on one of them.

![Entity history](../../assets/images/phenotype-editor-history.png)

You will enter a read-only mode of the selected version. In this mode you can examine the metadata of that version and restore it by clicking on "Restore".
